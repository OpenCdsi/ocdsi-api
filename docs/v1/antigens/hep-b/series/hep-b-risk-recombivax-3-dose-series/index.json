Patients and staff members who do not respond to the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated with three additional doses and retested for response. No additional series should be administered (i.e., a 3rd full series). The patient should receive yearly boosters starting 1 year after completion of the second series.","Retest patients who respond to the vaccine annually for anti-HBs. If anti-HBs declines to less than 10 mIU/mL, administer a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and continue to retest annually. Retesting immediately after the booster dose is not necessary. For staff members who respond to the vaccine, booster doses of vaccine are not necessary, and periodic serologic testing to monitor antibody concentrations is not recommended","Routine childhood vaccination against hepatitis B has been recommended since 1991 and routine adolescent vaccination since 1995. Thus, many persons who develop end-stage renal failure will have a history of vaccination against hepatitis B. These persons should have responded to the vaccine when their immune status was normal, but if their anti-HBs levels are less than 10 mIU/mL when they begin dialysis, they should be revaccinated with a complete primary series."],"seriesType":"Risk","equivalentSeriesGroups":"","requiredGender":[""],"selectSeries":{"defaultSeries":"No","productPath":"Yes","seriesGroupName":"Increased Risk","seriesGroup":"2","seriesPriority":"A","seriesPreference":"","minAgeToStart":"20 years","maxAgeToStart":""},"indication":[{"observationCode":{"text":"Dialysis patient","code":"032"},"description":"Administer to hemodialysis patients and predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis patients","beginAge":"20 years","endAge":"","guidance":""}],"seriesDose":[{"doseNumber":"Dose 1","age":[{"absMinAge":"0 days","minAge":"20 years","earliestRecAge":"20 years","latestRecAge":"","maxAge":"","effectiveDate":"","cessationDate":""}],"interval":[{"fromPrevious":null,"fromTargetDose":null,"fromMostRecent":null,"fromRelevantObs":null,"absMinInt":null,"minInt":null,"earliestRecInt":null,"latestRecInt":null,"intervalPriority":null,"effectiveDate":null,"cessationDate":null}],"allowableInterval":[{"fromPrevious":null,"fromTargetDose":null,"absMinInt":null,"effectiveDate":null,"cessationDate":null}],"preferableVaccine":[{"vaccineType":"Hep B, Dialysis","cvx":"44","beginAge":"20 years","endAge":"","tradeName":"","mvx":"","volume":"1","forecastVaccineType":"N"}],"allowableVaccine":[{"vaccineType":"Hep B, Dialysis","cvx":"44","beginAge":"0 days","endAge":""}],"inadvertentVaccine":[{"vaccineType":null,"cvx":null}],"conditionalSkip":[{"context":"Both","setLogic":"n/a","set":[{"setID":"1","setDescription":"Dose is not required if the patient has received a complete standard series of vaccinations","effectiveDate":"","cessationDate":"","conditionLogic":"","condition":[{"conditionID":"1","conditionType":"Completed Series","startDate":"","endDate":"","beginAge":"","endAge":"","interval":"","doseCount":"","doseType":"","doseCountLogic":"","vaccineTypes":"","seriesGroups":"1"}]}]}],"recurringDose":"No","seasonalRecommendation":{"startDate":null,"endDate":null}},{"doseNumber":"Dose 2","age":[{"absMinAge":"","minAge":"","earliestRecAge":"","latestRecAge":"","maxAge":"","effectiveDate":"","cessationDate":""}],"interval":[{"fromPrevious":"Y","fromTargetDose":"","fromMostRecent":"","fromRelevantObs":{"text":null,"code":null},"absMinInt":"4 weeks -
